# GitHub-Collaboration-Exercise
This project was completed using Git Bash, VSCode, and the GitHub interface.
All group members set up their workspace on their respective systems.
We then created three branches for ourselves and committed all of the changes to them.
We also edited each other's files and committed those changes.
At the end, we created pull requests to merge all branches into the main branch and resolved conflicts related to differing data before merging.
