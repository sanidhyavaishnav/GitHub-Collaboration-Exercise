this time we learned a lot about using git hub 
we could commit to same or differnet branches depending upon what we were working was same or spearate 
at the ned we put pull requests to merge all branches in the main nranch and commited it 
we reviewd a discrepancy and fixed it 

this is really powerful tool to be used for making projects together as you can work on them without disrupting other people 
at the end you acan review and merge everything to a single project which everyone can access and use
